To add a test, create a new directory that contains at least these three files:
  run       executable, typically a script
  good.out  what should be printed on stdout
  good.err  what should be printed on stderr

In most cases you'd want to use the default script run, and a helper Config.java:
  ( mkdir NEWTEST; cd NEWTEST; ln -s ../defaults/* . )
Then you create dummy reference outputs:
  touch NEWTEST/good.{out,err}
Then you write your test. If you use defaults/run, as we are in this paragraph,
then you must create two files:
  NEWTEST/Main.java   the Java code to run
  NEWTEST/prop.topl   the TOPL property to check
Then run your new test:
  ./test NEWTEST
It should fail because we're using dummy reference outputs.

When a test T fails (not necessarily a new one), do
  diff -u T/out T/good.out
  diff -u T/err T/good.err
Also, inspect T/out and T/err. If you decide that T/out and T/err are OK,
then use them as reference outputs:
  cp T/out T/good.out
  cp T/err T/good.err

Finally, if you just run
  ./test
then the tests being run are those listen in ./alltests. So, do
  echo NEWTEST >> alltests
